# Constructor-Hangman
 UNC Coding Boot Camp - Constructor Hangman - Assignment #9 (Advanced JS)
 <p></p>
 
**MyRant** - the obsession with hangman is real. This time the game was created using Javascript constructors and a few NPM packages. The entire game is designed to run and display the results in the, not so marked up, terminal bash terminal window; War Games all over again. 

**MyBonus** - display a stick hangman graphic in the terminal for each incorrect letter entered!

## Features

* Guess random word by entering a single character and press enter (Hint: [Justice Movie League Superheros](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974015/))
* Each incorrect letter displays progressive hangman stick figure and remaining incorrect attempts
* Each character that is a correct will be displayed in the terminal
* Each word allows 10 attempts to guess the correct word(s)

- Inquirer NPM Package - [https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- is-letter NPM Package - [https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-letter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-letter)

## Future Improvement
* Consider making the app accept a single character input and immediately evaluate the results without pressing enter
* Research if node terminal bash can give two simple pc sounds for correct and incorrect inputs
